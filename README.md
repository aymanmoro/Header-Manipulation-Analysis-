## Overview
This project demonstrates and analyzes web application vulnerabilities related to HTTP header manipulation, with a specific focus on Host Header attacks. It includes both a vulnerable and a secured version of a Flask-based blog application to showcase security implementations and best practices.

## Features
- Basic blog functionality with posts, categories, and tags
- Search functionality
- Pagination
- Demonstration of common header manipulation vulnerabilities
- Secure implementation with proper header configurations
- Examples of attack vectors and their mitigations

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup
#1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate

#2. Install dependencies:

pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-talisman python-slugify

#Usage
#Running the Vulnerable Application

python app.py

The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000


#3. Running the Secured Application

python appsec.py

# The secured version includes protection against:

    Clickjacking attacks
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    HTTP Host Header attacks
    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
#Security Features
Vulnerable Version (app.py)

    Basic Flask application without security headers
    Demonstrates common security misconfigurations
    Useful for educational purposes and security testing

#Secured Version (appsec.py)

    Implementation of Flask-Talisman
    Comprehensive security headers:
        X-Frame-Options
        Content-Security-Policy
        X-Content-Type-Options
        X-XSS-Protection
        Referrer-Policy
        Permissions-Policy
    HTTPS enforcement (disabled for local development)
    Protection against clickjacking
    Secure session management

#Security Features
 - Regular security header audits
 - Use security header scanning tools

3. **HTTPS Implementation**
 - Force HTTPS in production
 - Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
 - Use secure TLS configuration

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
 - Implement comprehensive logging
 - Monitor for suspicious activities
 - Set up alerts for security events

5. **Session Management**
 - Use secure cookies with `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags
 - Implement session expiration and rotation
 - Avoid storing sensitive data in cookies

6. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
 - Define a strict CSP to prevent XSS and data injection attacks
 - Regularly review and update the CSP

7. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**
 - Configure CORS policies to restrict unauthorized domains
 - Avoid using wildcard (`*`) for allowed origins

8. **Regular Security Audits**
 - Perform periodic security assessments
 - Use automated tools and manual testing
 - Stay updated with the latest security vulnerabilities and patches
